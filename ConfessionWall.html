        <p>Big Red Confession Wall is a safe and dynamic web application where any member of the community can write
          anonymous posts and like/dislike and comments on others' posts. Before, suggestions for a community were
          usually collected in a top-down manner. For example, leaders send out surveys to community members. There is a
          problem with this process because everyone's ideas ought to be seen by everyone else in order for the
          community to improve. Our confession, instead, helps suggestions bubble up in a bottom-up manner.</p>
        <p>
          It ensures
          the following three things:
          <p>
            1) Information safety. Posts are completely anonymous and hidden from viewers and even the administrators.
            A safe and friendly web space. A specific confession wall is only accessible within members of a certain
            community.</p>
          <p>
            2) Toxicity detection. Toxic and other suspicious contents will be labeled
            and hidden from users automatically by our NLP model until an admin looks at it and marks it otherwise.</p>
          <p>
            3) Engaging interface. We wanted to replace that brown suggestion box with a much more appealing web
            application.Inspired by Pinterest, our webpage will be really enjoyable to view and fun to interact with. We
            hope members
            of a community will never get bored using our platform.
